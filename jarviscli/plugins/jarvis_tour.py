                       1 - Provide Steam game AppId
                       2 - Provide Steam game Title
                       3 - Close

                       - Enter the Steam game AppId when prompted
                       - Get the ProtonDB rating for the game
                    
                    4. Using Game Title (Option 2)
                       - Enter the Steam game title when prompted
                       - Plugin searches for the game and retrieves its AppId

                    5. Notes
